## Logic of the app

- Take out the message form in the Chat.
- Create a View for sending a message and take the "SEND THE MESSAGE" out from the :show of user.
Link that new View in a button in the :show of user next to the "Choose a new room" button.
- Add the user_pic to the User model.
- Add several icons where the user that chose from during the sign-up
- Put the chosen icon across the views that use avatar of user
- Log in / Log out form
- When creating a message, call map API so that the user can link the restaurant, coffee shop...
and make a recommendation of it.
- Upvote comments.
- When creating a message and linking to a business (restaurant, coffee shop...), if there exists
already a recommendation made by someone, alert the user that someone already linked the business
and ask them to put their recommendation using that link.
- Authorization. Only the user can edit, create, delete his/her messages.
- Put most upvoted messages on the top of the recommendations

## Design

- Use the select2
- Put the colors standardized (the purple ones) and change the grey of "back" to a darker one.
- The layout of some pages is a mess, figure out how to make them more professional.
- Check some JS that we can do
- Check some plugins that we can use
- Check how to make the chat "scroll"
